    <h1>Welcome To My My first project uploaded here</h1>
    <p>This is the code to open a csv file that contains all you user and passwords and their respective website then organise it by email name
      and put it into seperate text files.</p>

    This is probalbly a very inefficient way to do it but whatever don't fix what isn't broken. I guess in the case of code fixing it to make it 
    better is good but in this case it is not for any production use but i digress.

    Now I pride myself of honesty so i will say I did use AI specifically chat gpt but that was due to me never using 'csv', 'collections' and I have used
    'os' twice in the past so I went in pretty blind but all's well.
